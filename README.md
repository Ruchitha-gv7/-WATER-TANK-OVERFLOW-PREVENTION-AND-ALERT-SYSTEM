# WATER-TANK-OVERFLOW-PREVENTION-AND-ALERT-SYSTEM
## Overview
Water is a critical resource requiring efficient management to ensure sustainability. Traditional water level monitoring methods are manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors. This project develops a smart water level monitoring system utilizing IoT technology to automate and enhance the accuracy of water level measurements. The system allows users to monitor water levels and receive alerts via the Blynk app from anywhere, reducing manual labor and eliminating errors associated with traditional methods. It promotes smarter water management and resource conservation.

## Working Principle
### Water Level Measurement:
The system measures water levels using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.
### Data Processing: 
Real-time data from the sensor is processed by the ESP32 microcontroller.
### IoT Integration:
The ESP32 sends water level updates to the Blynk IoT platform via Wi-Fi.
### Real-Time Notifications:
Users receive real-time notifications on their smartphones through the Blynk app for low and high water levels.
### Alarm System: 
A 5V DC buzzer alerts users when water levels reach critical thresholds, and a 2-pin push button allows manual deactivation of the alarm.
### System Operation:
The system operates continuously with stable performance and consistent monitoring. Initial calibration ensures accuracy, with periodic recalibration needed for temperature and tank shape variations. The breadboard setup allows for flexible adjustments during testing, with potential for more permanent assembly in long-term deployment.
## Results
Accurate Water Level Monitoring: The ultrasonic sensor precisely measures and updates water levels in real-time.
Effective Alarm System: The 5V DC buzzer reliably alerts users to critical water levels, with manual deactivation via the push button.
